I've updated the **Section Exploration & Issue Handling** part of the GDD to clearly state:

* **All module risk levels are determined at game start and visible on the map from the beginning.**
* The approximately 20 modules will be randomly assigned risk types according to the specified ratio: **~50% Safe, ~35% Medium, ~15% High.**

This ensures players can plan their exploration route based on known risks, while the randomization of *which* module gets *which* risk provides replayability.
